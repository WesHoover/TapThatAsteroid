A data visualization tool for Asteroids using the Asterank API (http://www.asterank.com/api) which pulls data from Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Small-Body Database (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi).
This tool will allow you to compare asteroids using their size, estimated profit, magnitude, etc.  
  
This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and a passion project for me, so development happens as I have time. Currently, you are only able to change the query limit amount to display 10, 100, 500, or 1000 asteroids sorted by their diameter. I plan to add hover state details to each "asteroid" that will illustrate the elemental makeup of each asteroid. In the far future, I'd like this to serve as a tool to aid in Asteroid proscpecting/mining.
