A data visualization tool for Asteroids using the Asterank API (http://www.asterank.com/api) which pulls data from Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Small-Body Database (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi).
This tool will allow you to compare asteroids using their size, estimated profit, magnitude, etc.  
  
Currently, you are only able to change the query limit amount to display 10, 100, 500, or 1000 asteroids sorted by their diameter.
